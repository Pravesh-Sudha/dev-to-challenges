# CSS Art: My Remote DevOps Workspace

## Overview

This project is my submission for the **Dev.TO Frontend Challenge**, where I recreated my real-life desk setup using HTML and CSS. My desk, the heart of my remote workspace as a Tech Blogger, Freelancer, and AWS Community Builder (Containers category, 2025), inspired this CSS Art. It features a desk with a laptop, external monitor, keyboard, mouse, and a water bottle labeled "AWS Community Builder," reflecting my journey in DevOps and content creation.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the CSS Art, including the desk setup and animated background.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file containing styles for the desk elements and a dynamic, multi-layered gradient background with animations.

## Inspiration

This CSS Art is a tribute to my remote workspace, where I’ve spent the last two years growing as a Tech Blogger and Freelancer. Recently selected as an **AWS Community Builder** under the Containers category, I’ve expanded my setup with a MacBook Air M3, external monitor, and more, all of which are reflected in this project. Creating this art was a fun dive into web development, teaching me advanced CSS techniques like animations and positioning, even though my primary focus is DevOps and Cloud.
